macro:->This
notation
describes
the
branch
in
terms
of
both
$N$
and
$J$:
$^{\Delta
N}\Delta
J_{ul}$.
If
$\Delta
N
=
\Delta
J$,
then
the
notation
uses
one
letter
to
mark
the
type
of
branch.
$u$
and
$l$
denote
the
spin
orientation
of
the
upper
state
and
the
lower
state
in
a
transition.
In
our
case,
the
upper
state
could
be
the
$A^2\Pi
_{1/2}$
or
the
$A^2\Pi
_{3/2}$
state,
which
are
denoted
by
$u=1$
and
$u=2$
respectively.
The
lower
state
is
the
$X^2
\Sigma
^{+}$
state
with
$S=1/2$.
We
choose
the
convention
of
$l=1$
($l=2$)
to
represent
$J=N+1/2$
($J=N-1/2$).
